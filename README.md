# PHISHING-DETECTION-USING-ML-AND-LOOPY-BELIEF-PROPOGATION
This project focuses on detecting phishing URLs by leveraging graph-based machine learning techniques combined with Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP). Unlike traditional methods that rely only on URL string features, this approach models the structural and relational properties of URLs, IP addresses, and domain servers as a graph.
